# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description

This project is part of the **Holberton School** curriculum. It aims to teach the basics of **matrix manipulation** in **Python**.

The main objective of this project is to write a function that rotates a 2D matrix **90 degrees clockwise**.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4 or higher
- PEP 8 style

## Tasks

### [0. Rotate 2D Matrix]

Write a function that rotates a 2D matrix **90 degrees clockwise**.

- Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`
- Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited **in-place**.
- You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.

Example:

```python
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]]
>>> rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)
>>> matrix
[[7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]]
```

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Rotate 2D Matrix**<br/>[0-rotate_2d_matrix.py](0-rotate_2d_matrix.py) contains a module with a function that rotates an `n` x `n` 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise with the following requirements:
  + Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`.
  + Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited **in-place**.
  + You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
